/**
 * An object that maps keys to values.  A map cannot contain duplicate keys;
 * each key can map to at most one value.
 *
 * <p>This interface takes the place of the <tt>Dictionary</tt> class, which
 * was a totally abstract class rather than an interface.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>Map</tt> interface provides three <i>collection views</i>, which
 * allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values,
 * or set of key-value mappings.  The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as
 * the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their
 * elements.  Some map implementations, like the <tt>TreeMap</tt> class, make
 * specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class, do not.
 *
 * <p>Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map
 * keys.  The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is
 * changed in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is a
 * key in the map.  A special case of this prohibition is that it is not
 * permissible for a map to contain itself as a key.  While it is permissible
 * for a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is advised: the
 * equals and hashCode methods are no longer well defined on a such a map.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two
 * "standard" constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an
 * empty map, and a constructor with a single argument of type <tt>Map</tt>,
 * which creates a new map with the same key-value mappings as its argument.
 * In effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any map,
 * producing an equivalent map of the desired class.  There is no way to
 * enforce this recommendation (as interfaces cannot contain constructors) but
 * all of the general-purpose map implementations in the JDK comply.
 *
 * <p>The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the
 * methods that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw
 * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if this map does not support the
 * operation.  If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required
 * to, throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the invocation would
 * have no effect on the map.  For example, invoking the {@link #putAll(Map)}
 * method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required to, throw the
 * exception if the map whose mappings are to be "superimposed" is empty.
 *
 * <p>Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they
 * may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and
 * values, and some have restrictions on the types of their keys.  Attempting
 * to insert an ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception,
 * typically <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.
 * Attempting to query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an
 * exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit
 * the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally,
 * attempting an operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion
 * would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may
 * throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the 
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../guide/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
 *
 * <p>Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined
 * in terms of the {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method.  For
 * example, the specification for the {@link #containsKey(Object)
 * contains(Object key)} method says: "returns <tt>true</tt> if and
 * only if this map contain a mapping for a key <tt>k</tt> such that
 * <tt>(key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))</tt>." This specification should
 * <i>not</i> be construed to imply that invoking <tt>Map.containsKey</tt>
 * with a non-null argument <tt>key</tt> will cause <tt>key.equals(k)</tt> to
 * be invoked for any key <tt>k</tt>.  Implementations are free to
 * implement optimizations whereby the <tt>equals</tt> invocation is avoided,
 * for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys.  (The
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} specification guarantees that two objects with
 * unequal hash codes cannot be equal.)  More generally, implementations of
 * the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
 * the specified behavior of underlying {@link Object} methods wherever the
 * implementor deems it appropriate.
